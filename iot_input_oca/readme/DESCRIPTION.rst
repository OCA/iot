This addon allows to use a device in order to input data to odoo automatically.

It opens a URL that a device can use to connect (with a password) that can only
execute an specific action.

Inputs are useful when a device wants to communicate to odoo for a single
and simple action.
This way, the device does not need to be configured with a odoo user and
password, it is handled by odoo devices.

Examples:

* Sending the temperature every three minutes.
* Sending the RFID that the device has received in order to perform some action
