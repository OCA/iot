This addon allows to define IoT Rules.

A Rule specifies which Inputs that can be controlled by a certain Key.
The Key is owned by an Agent (Employee, Partner or anonymous). The Input
is a request from an IoT Device that executes a certain function in
Odoo. This function will check if the Key (= the Agent) is allowed by
any Rule to "control" the Device. If Odoo answers positively the Agent
will be allowed the to execute some Function on the Device (for example
open a door or switch on a relay).
